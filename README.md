Language: Java/Kotlin

Description: Prescription Planner is an app designed to help its users track recurring medical responsibilities. The app lets users to add their tasks to a list that allows users to mark those notes as complete. It also allows them to modify or delete those tasks from the list. This system is designed as a memory aid as well as serving as an organizational tool to help keep track of prescription-related dosage timing.

To Run: This app runs on Android Studios, which creates an emulation of a Google Pixel API 28. To boot the application, open the program files inside Android Studios and select the correct emulator (Google Pixel with API around 30 should work). Start up that emulator, then hit the play button to run the app inside the emulator. This should trigger the splash screen and then take you to the app's main functionality.
